# Turtle Race Game
## [Turtle Race Game](Turtle-Race-Game.py)

This game will help us to understand about classes and objects: Timmy until now has been an object of the turtle class, objects would be individual levels of a "species" that we call class: His blue bic pen is an object of the "species" pen, that is, of the pen class.
Based on that, we can create more than one individual that would be our object: we will have other turtles besides timmy: tommy, alice, bob, anna, jimmy, jack. Each one will have its own color

### Description:

Place your bets! Choose your favorite turtle based on its color and watch them race to the finish line.

### How to Play:
