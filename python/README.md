# Python projects
In this repository, you will have several projects, one hundred to be more specific, ranging from the basics of programming in python to advanced.
## Documetation available in Portuguese in projects
:brazil: :us:
I've been doing these projects as part of a bootcamp, and I want to make them available to help all those who want to learn python (trying to do the projects will definitely make you learn programming well)

## Basic projects: 
In basic projects, you will find projects that practice use of variables, functions, loops and if conditions.
If you keep going over the projects, they will become harder. lists and dicts will be used over some of these projects
