# Password Generator

Generate strong and custom passwords with ease! This command-line application allows you to determine the number of letters, symbols, and numbers in your password, ensuring both security and memorability.


## [Password Generator Script](main.py)

## Goals
The objective is to train the use of lists to store information, which we call elements (study about lists before doing this project), and use a module (study what modules are in python), in this case random to choose, through the randint method, a random value, and through the shuffle method, we will "randomize" a string to generate a password.
Here we will again reinforce the FOR repetition structure
