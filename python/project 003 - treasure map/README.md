# Treasure Island Game

## Description

Embark on an adventure to find the hidden treasure on Treasure Island. Be careful, as your choices will determine your fate. Navigate the crossroads, traverse the lake, and choose the correct door to find the treasure. But beware - danger lurks around every corner.

From this project you will learn to use the conditional if structure. With this very few options project, you will already be able to create a text rpg the way it was done in the old days (for best results, good to learn for and while repetition structures, we will see about this in later projects).

## How to Play

1. Execute the script.
2. You'll find yourself at a crossroad. Choose to go either 'left' or 'right'.
3. If you make it past the crossroad, decide whether to 'wait' for a boat at a lake or 'swim' across.
4. If you've successfully crossed the lake, you'll face three doors: red, yellow, and blue. Choose wisely.

## Outcomes

Your decisions will lead to various outcomes. Some will lead to treasure, while others, unfortunately, will lead to peril.

## Requirements

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine to run the game.
