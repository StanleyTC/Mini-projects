# Random names

This project is the first hundred projects we will do to become master in python (so, it is the simplest project).
All we need to do is create a program to generate random names.

## How it works?
This project is the simplest project in this repository, it will only serve for the user to learn how to print information on the screen, as well as learn the use of variables and string concatenation
* Enter a name and it will store in a variable
* Enter another name and it will store in another variable
* At the end the program will put everything together and print it on the user's screen
  
## Do not fool yourself!
this project can be very basic, but the others will increase the degree of difficulty little by little, try to finish this one before going to project 2, and project 2 before going to project 3, and so on...
Remember that the goal is to always practice as much as you can.
