# The turtle program (starting learning Graphical User Interface)
For this program, we will use the standard library that comes with python called turtle, and we will import the Turtle class, where we will use the turtle to generate a screen with images of colored spheres in random and ordered order, forming a kind of square 100x100, where each coordinate point is represented by a sphere.

## Goals
The objective of this project is to practice and learn the basics of a graphical user interface.
### What do I need to learn for this project?
* Understand about turtle library documentation, easy to find on google
* learn to manipulate the turtle, know how to change its color, know how to make it move in random positions, draw geometric figures and generate random colors for it (google, documentation and stack overflow can help with all this)
* Learning how to make a spirograph, this is basically telling the turtle to make a circle, and then you tell it to tilt a little bit to make another one and thus generate a huge "donut" of circles, search on google for an image of a spirograph, you can send the turtle to bend ordering it to turn left or right and put an angle value for it to represent, the "for" method can help you
* Make a function that generates random colors, as present in my code

# What will I learn from this?
* Working with classes (in the turtle case)
* Working with basic GUI generation

# What modules will I need?
For the specific project, only two
* turtle
* random
