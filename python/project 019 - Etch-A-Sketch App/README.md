# Etch-A-Sketch and Turtle Race Game 

## Etch-A-Sketch Game
Continuing to explore the turtle library we used in project 18, the idea now is to build two little projects: a racing game between turtles and an etch-a-sketch game.
the goal is to train the use of a function being sent as a parameter to another function, and for this we do not use the parentheses () is this second function, only the name of the function
