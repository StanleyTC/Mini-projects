# Simple Encryption and Decryption Tool

This is a project about a famous encryption used in many situations: The Caesar Cipher. Utilizing the age-old Caesar Cipher methodology, this project provides an easy-to-understand introduction to text-based encryption using Python.

You will continue to strengthen your learning in loops, lists and functions with parameters, so try to study these well before doing this project.
I decided not to create a separate file for the ASCII art, precisely because it was just a sentence, so I put it directly in the code.

## [Main Script](main.py)

### Description:

This script encompasses a basic tool that lets users encrypt a plain text or decrypt a ciphered message. Given a specific shift number, each character in the text will be shifted up or down the alphabet, turning plain text into an unreadable mess or vice-versa.

### Features:

- **Encrypt Text:** Convert your plain text into a ciphered message.
- **Decrypt Text:** Revert a ciphered message back to its original form.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easily interact and choose between encoding or decoding text.
  
## Core Concepts Covered:

By working with and studying this project, learners can deepen their understanding of:

1. **Strings & List Manipulations:** This project extensively uses string and list operations like indexing, appending, and looping.
   
2. **Functions:** Encapsulation of code logic into reusable `encrypt` and `decrypt` functions.
   
3. **Conditional Statements:** Utilization of `if`, `elif`, and `else` to navigate the program's logic based on user input.
   
4. **Input & Output Operations:** Taking inputs from the user and providing corresponding outputs.
    
5. **Basic Cryptography:** Introduction to Caesar Cipher - a type of substitution cipher.
    
6. **Error Handling:** Basic handling of unexpected user inputs.

## How to Use:

1. Run the main script.
2. Choose between 'encode' to encrypt and 'decode' to decrypt.
3. Input the text you wish to work on.
4. Define a shift number. This will determine how many places each character will be moved up or down the alphabet.
5. View the encrypted or decrypted result!

## Requirements:

- Python
