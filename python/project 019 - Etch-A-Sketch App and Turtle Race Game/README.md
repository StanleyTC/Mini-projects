# Etch-A-Sketch and Turtle Race Game 

## Etch-A-Sketch Game
Continuing to explore the turtle library we used in project 18, the idea now is to build two little projects: a racing game between turtles and an etch-a-sketch game.
the goal is to train the use of a function being sent as a parameter to another function, and for this we do not use the parentheses () is this second function, only the name of the function

## Turtle Race Game
This game will help us to understand about classes and objects: Timmy until now has been an object of the turtle class, objects would be individual levels of a "species" that we call class: His blue bic pen is an object of the "species" pen, that is, of the pen class.
Based on that, we can create more than one individual that would be our object: we will have other turtles besides timmy: tommy, alice, bob, anna, jimmy, jack. Each one will have its own color
