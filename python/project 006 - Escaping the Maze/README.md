# Escaping the Maze

This project will not run on your computer! if you try, it will give an error because the functions were not created. The main thing that will be trained within this program is certainly the use of functions, study this well before starting.

## What is this code used for?

This code was developed to solve the puzzle located at:

https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%

That is, your goal will be to try to learn how to use functions, repetition structures and conditional structures to escape the maze. After this challenge, you will be well-acquainted with these structures and will be able to have a greater mastery of python programming (of course we are still in the basics)

## Do not give up

This project can take a whole day or even more than a day if you're a total beginner, that doesn't mean that the others would also take that long, but with what has already been required in previous projects, it's good that you reinforce your programming logic well to get through this project and be able to proceed to the others with your more developed programming logic, so it can be a lot of work, and remember: it's not about trying to do all the projects as quickly as possible, it's just about doing them.


## Requirements:

- Access the link and try to solve, you don't need to install python at your computer to complete this project
